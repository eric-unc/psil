This is the documentation for the `math` module.

---
## %
`%` divides the first rand by the remaining rands, and gives the remainder. It is the modulo operator.

Parameters:
* `val1`: (number) the value that is modulo from (the "dividend" or "numerator").
* `val2`: (number) the first value to by modulo by (or the first "divisor" or "denominator").
* `val3`: (OPTIONAL) (number) the second value to modulo by (or the second "divisor" or "denominator"). There may be more rands.

---
## *
`*` multiplies all rands given.

Parameters:
* `val1`: (number) the first value to be multiplied.
* `val2`: (number) the second value to be multiplied.
* `val3`: (OPTIONAL) (number) the third value to be multiplied. There may be more rands.

---
## +
`+` adds all rands given.

Parameters:
* `val1`: (number) the first value to be added.
* `val2`: (number) the second value to be added.
* `val3`: (OPTIONAL) (number) the third value to be added. There may be more rands.

---
## -
`-` subtracts the first rand by the remaining rands.

Parameters:
* `val1`: (number) the value that is subtracted from (the "minuend").
* `val2`: (number) the first value to be subtracted by (or the first "subtrahend").
* `val3`: (OPTIONAL) (number) the second value to be subtracted by (or second "subtrahend"). There may be more rands.

---
## /
`/` divides the first rand by the remaining rands.

Parameters:
* `val1`: (number) the value that is divided from (the "dividend" or "numerator").
* `val2`: (number) the first value to divide by (or the first "divisor" or "denominator").
* `val3`: (OPTIONAL) (number) the second value to divide by (or the second "divisor" or "denominator"). There may be more rands.

---
## is-num?
`is-num?` checks if the given rand is a number.

Parameters:
* `val`: (any) the value to be checked if it is a number.
